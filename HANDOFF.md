Added `WITH CHECK` on 7 UPDATE policies. Profile escalation guard prevents self-service `is_admin`/`plan_tier` changes. Fixed 5 function search paths. 8/8 verification checks pass. Zero Supabase security linter warnings.
**Sprint 13** - Server-side Stripe price allowlist on checkout/webhook. Structured JSON billing logs on all 3 edge functions. Frontend env validation. Return URL validation. Deployed checkout (v6) and portal (v5) to Supabase.
**Sprint 12** - Eliminated all 25 ESLint errors (0 errors remaining). Fixed Admin PLANS/allPlans mismatch, Traceability hooks violation, unreachable code in client.js. Extracted PLANS to constants/plans.js. Cleaned unused vars across 11 files.
**Sprint 11** - Fixed recipes 38-44 missing ingredients data issue
**Sprint 10** - Fixed Admin page `TIER_FEATURES` error, updated Stripe pricing (Maker $6/mo, Mfr $19/mo), repaired checkout JWT issues
**Sprint 9** - Rebranded Calculator → Formula Designer, built formulations library with save/load, added recipe templates

## Known Issues (To Be Addressed - Sprint 11+)

### ✅ Sprint 11. Recipes 38-44 Missing Ingredients (Data Issue)
- **Symptoms**: Bulk-created recipes (ID 38-44, e.g., "Hemp & Olive") have 0 ingredients defined.
- **Impact**: Creating batches for these recipes works but triggers no inventory drawdown.
- **Status**: Resolved (2026-02-21); Missing ingredients were successfully inserted into the `recipe_ingredients` table.

## 🚀 Approved Roadmap: Sprint 12-18

### ✅ Sprint 12: Production Blockers (Completed 2026-02-21)
- ✅ Fixed Admin `PLANS`/`allPlans` mismatch.
- ✅ Resolved all lint errors (25 → 0 errors, 7 warnings remain as intentional `exhaustive-deps`).
- ✅ Fixed React rules-of-hooks violation in `Traceability.jsx`.
- ✅ Fixed unreachable code bug in `getDashboardStats` (customer/sales/supply counts now fetched).
- ✅ Extracted `PLANS`/`TIER_LEVELS` to `src/constants/plans.js` for clean separation.
- ✅ Updated ESLint config with `argsIgnorePattern` and context file overrides.
- ⬚ Environment validation for Supabase/Stripe (deferred to Sprint 13+).
- ⬚ Smoke E2E ship gate (deferred to Sprint 17-18).

### ✅ Sprint 13: Billing Security Hardening (Completed 2026-02-21)
- ✅ Server-side Stripe price allowlist (`ALLOWED_STRIPE_PRICE_IDS` env var).
- ✅ Reject tampered/invalid client price IDs with 403 + structured error log.
- ✅ Structured JSON billing logs on all 3 edge functions (checkout, portal, webhook).
- ✅ Environment validation (fail-fast for missing secrets).
- ✅ Return URL validation (prevent open redirects via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
- ✅ Frontend env validation (`src/lib/validateEnv.js`) with fail-fast for Supabase, warnings for Stripe.
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes (401/403/400/500 instead of generic 400).
- ✅ Supabase Secrets verified and added via browser subagent.
- ⬚ Negative billing-path tests (deferred to Sprint 16/17).
- ⚠️ Webhook deploy failed (Supabase internal error — retry needed via CLI).

### ✅ Sprint 14: Database Safety Baseline (Completed 2026-02-21)
- ✅ Full RLS audit across 21 public tables.
- ✅ Dropped 13 duplicate/redundant policies (catch-all ALL + per-command coexistence).
- ✅ Fixed 8 tables granting to `public` role → now require `authenticated`.
- ✅ Added `WITH CHECK` on 7 UPDATE policies (prevent user_id reassignment).
- ✅ Profile escalation guard (`trg_prevent_profile_escalation`) — users cannot self-modify `is_admin` or `plan_tier`.
- ✅ Admin UPDATE policy for profiles — admins can manage `plan_tier` on other users.
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate SELECT policies on profiles table.
- ✅ Fixed 5 function search paths (`complete_batch`, `convert_weight`, `increment_stock`, `decrement_stock`, `update_updated_at`).
- ✅ 8-check verification script (`verify_rls_policies.sql`) — all pass.
- ✅ Supabase security linter: 0 RLS/function warnings remaining.
- ⚠️ Leaked password protection disabled (Auth dashboard setting, not a code change).

- Add release checklist (schema/function/env/rollback).
- Define staging promotion criteria and signoff rubric.
- Capture residual risk register and formal go/no-go process.
