## 🎯 **Slide 2: The Problem**

### 20,000+ Soap Businesses Are Stuck in the Spreadsheet Dark Ages

**Pain Points:**
1. **Time Drain:** 5-10 hrs/week managing recipes, inventory, and sales across scattered spreadsheets

4. **Opportunity Cost:** Makers spend more time on admin than creating new products

**Market Quote:**
*"I love making soap. I hate tracking inventory. One formula error cost me $200 in wasted ingredients."*
— Typical artisan soap maker

## 🎯 **Slide 12: Why Now?**

### Perfect Storm of Market, Technology, and Timing

**Market Inflection Points:**
1. **COVID Shift:** Artisan businesses went online, need cloud tools (2020-2024 acceleration)
2. **Regulatory Pressure:** FDA increased scrutiny on cosmetics labeling (2023-2024)
3. **Generational Shift:** Younger makers expect SaaS tools, don't want desktop software
4. **E-commerce Maturity:** Shopify, Etsy, Stripe made selling soap online accessible

**Technological Enablers:**

**Competitive Window:**
- **SoapMaker Pro** hasn't updated in 5+ years (asleep at the wheel)

- **SoapMaker Pro** has 10K+ customers at $130-$200 (willingness to pay proven)
- **Craftybase** has 5K+ customers at $19-$99/mo (SaaS model works in craft industry)

**The Opportunity:** First-mover advantage to capture 20K+ soap businesses before incumbents wake up.

## ❓ **Slide 15: Risk Factors**

### Transparent Assessment of Key Risks

**Market Risks:**
1. **Limited TAM:** Soap market is niche (~20K businesses)
   - *Mitigation:* Expand to adjacent markets (candles, cosmetics, herbalism) in Year 2-3

2. **Seasonal Churn:** Some makers only sell during holidays
   - *Mitigation:* Annual billing discount (15%), demonstrate year-round value (tax prep, planning)

3. **Price Sensitivity:** Craft businesses are budget-conscious
   - *Mitigation:* Free tier, 14-day trial, ROI calculator showing time savings

**Competitive Risks:**
1. **SoapMaker Pro Launches Cloud:** Incumbent releases SaaS version
   - *Mitigation:* Move fast (6-12 month head start), build community moat, superior UX

2. **Well-Funded Competitor:** VC-backed startup enters with $5M war chest
   - *Mitigation:* Domain expertise, early customer lock-in, recipe data creates switching costs

**Execution Risks:**
1. **Solo Founder:** Key person risk if you're the only team member
   - *Mitigation:* Hire co-founder/CTO (equity), build advisory board, document processes

2. **Customer Acquisition:** Can't reach target market cost-effectively
   - *Mitigation:* Multi-channel approach (organic + paid + partnerships), iterate quickly

**Technological Risks:**
1. **Supabase Vendor Lock-In:** Platform dependency
   - *Mitigation:* Standard PostgreSQL schema, can migrate to AWS RDS if needed

2. **Security Breach:** Customer data compromise
   - *Mitigation:* SOC 2 compliance prep, security audits, encryption, bug bounty program

**Overall Risk Assessment:** **Medium** (balanced by strong market need, technical execution, and multiple exit paths)

**Visual:** Risk matrix (Impact vs. Probability) with mitigation strategies
