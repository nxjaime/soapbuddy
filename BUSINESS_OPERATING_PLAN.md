# SoapBuddy - Business Operating Plan
**Last Updated:** February 21, 2026
**Status:** Pre-Launch / Market Validation Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**Product:** SoapBuddy - A modern, cloud-based business management platform for artisan soap makers and small cosmetics manufacturers.

**Problem:** Artisan soap makers currently rely on desktop software (SoapMaker Pro), Excel spreadsheets, or generic business tools that don't understand the unique needs of soap formulation, lye calculations, inventory management for perishable ingredients, and compliance labeling.

**Solution:** A web-based SaaS platform combining professional recipe formulation, automated lye calculations, intelligent inventory management, batch production tracking, multi-channel sales management, and financial analytics in one integrated system.

**Market Opportunity:** $1.2B+ artisan soap and handmade cosmetics market (US alone), with 50,000+ active soap businesses and growing DIY/craft market.

## 5. Success Probability Assessment

### Overall Success Probability: **65-70%** *(Reaching $1M ARR within 3 years)*

#### Factors Increasing Success Probability ✅

1. **Clear Market Need (HIGH CONFIDENCE - 85%)**
   - Existing desktop software proves demand
   - Modern cloud-based alternative is inevitable market shift
   - Direct pain points validated through competitor reviews

2. **Defensible Niche (MEDIUM-HIGH - 75%)**
   - Domain expertise creates barriers to entry
   - Not large enough for Big Tech, too specialized for generic tools
   - Network effects through recipe sharing

3. **Technical Feasibility (HIGH - 90%)**
   - Tech stack proven (React, Supabase, Stripe)
   - Core features already spec'd and buildable
   - No major technical risks identified

4. **Founder-Market Fit (ASSESS NEEDED)**
   - Do you have direct experience in soap making industry?
   - Do you have existing relationships with potential beta users?
   - Strong fit = +20% to success probability

#### Risk Factors Decreasing Success ⚠️

1. **Market Size Risk (MEDIUM)**
   - Niche market (~20K qualified buyers)
   - Limited expansion beyond soap/cosmetics
   - **Mitigation:** Expand to adjacent markets (candles, herbalism, small-batch food)

2. **Acquisition Cost Risk (MEDIUM-HIGH)**
   - Scattered target market (not easy to reach online)
   - Influencer dependency in early stages
   - **Mitigation:** Strong SEO strategy, community building, partnerships

3. **Churn Risk (MEDIUM)**
   - Seasonal businesses (some makers only sell at holidays)
   - Price sensitivity in craft market
   - **Mitigation:** Annual pricing discount, indispensable features (inventory automation)

4. **Competitive Response (LOW-MEDIUM)**
   - SoapMaker Pro could launch cloud version
   - Shopify could add soap-specific plugins
   - **Mitigation:** Move fast, build community moat, lock in integrations

### Success Scenario Breakdown

| Scenario | Probability | Year 3 ARR | Description |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Base Hit** | 40% | $500K-$1M | Solid niche product, sustainable business, 1-2 founders |
| **Home Run** | 20% | $3M-$5M | Market leader, strong brand, 5-10 person team, acquisition interest |
| **Unicorn Path** | 5% | $10M+ | Platform play, expand to all craft manufacturing, VC-backed scale |
| **Failure** | 35% | <$100K | Poor product-market fit, can't crack acquisition, feature parity with incumbents |

## 7. Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap-First Approach (Recommended)

**Why Bootstrap:**
- Low infrastructure costs ($500-$2K/mo for Supabase, hosting, tools)
- Can reach profitability on modest customer base (150-200 customers)
- Maintain full control and equity
- Validate business model before seeking capital

**Funding Needs by Phase:**

| Phase | Capital Needed | Use of Funds | Source |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **Pre-Launch (0-3 mo)** | $10K-$15K | Development, initial marketing | Personal savings, credit |
| **Launch (4-6 mo)** | $20K-$30K | Marketing, first hires, trade shows | Revenue + personal investment |
| **Scale (7-12 mo)** | $50K-$75K | Team expansion, paid acquisition | Revenue (ideally profitable) |

### Alternative: Raise Small Seed Round

**If you choose to raise capital:**
- **Target:** $250K-$500K seed round at $2M-$3M valuation
- **Investor Profile:** Angels with SaaS experience, craft industry investors, micro-VCs
- **Use of Funds:**
  - 50% marketing & customer acquisition
  - 30% product development (hire engineer)
  - 20% operations & runway
- **Timing:** Raise after Product-Market Fit validation (200+ customers, <5% churn)

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Supabase outage | High | Implement monitoring, backup to AWS RDS if needed, SLA review |

| Security breach | Critical | SOC 2 compliance prep, security audits, encryption at rest/transit |
| Scaling performance | Medium | Database optimization, CDN for assets, load testing at 500 users |

### Market Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Incumbent launches cloud product | High | Move fast, build community moat, exclusive partnerships |
| Market too small | Critical | Early validation through beta, expand to adjacent markets (candles, cosmetics) |
| Can't reach target users | High | Multi-channel marketing, influencer partnerships, SEO investment |
| High churn | High | Onboarding optimization, customer success program, indispensable features |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Solo founder burnout | High | Build advisory board, delegate early, set sustainable pace |
| Regulatory changes | Medium | Monitor FDA/cosmetics regulations, build compliance features proactively |
| Key person dependency | Medium | Document processes, cross-train, modular codebase |

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

**SoapBuddy has a 65-70% probability of becoming a sustainable, profitable business** if executed with focus on:

1. **Relentless customer obsession** - Build exactly what soap makers need, not what you think is cool
2. **Community-first GTM** - Your best marketing is happy users telling other soap makers
3. **Disciplined execution** - Ship fast, iterate based on data, don't overbuild
4. **Sustainable growth** - Bootstrap as long as possible, only raise capital with clear ROI

**The market exists. The pain is real. The solution is buildable.**

Your biggest risks are:
- Failing to reach customers (solve with content + community)
- Building features nobody uses (solve with weekly user interviews)
- Running out of runway (solve with bootstrap mindset + quick monetization)

**Recommended decision:** Commit to 6-month beta/launch sprint. If you hit 200 paying customers by Month 6 with <5% churn, you have a real business. If not, pivot or sunset gracefully.

You've built the technical foundation. Now it's time to build the business around it.

**Document Maintenance:**
